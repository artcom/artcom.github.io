# Travel the world by loving coding and VR

This is a short post about coding brought me to the other side of the world.

## But first...

TODO: Link VRBLN
But the story begins two weeks earlier. I was sitting in my bed and and read in the VRBLN - Meetup group that a they are going to host the VRCore Worldwide Championship VRHackathon 2017. I was very excited but realised I'm not in Berlin this weekend. I told my girlfriend Monica about my disappointment and she pointed out that we are going to be back on saturday afternoon. I realised that this time would kind of fit and called all my friends and colleagues to encourage them to join me for the hackathon.

Soon we had found a team of 4 and bought the entry tickets which were like 25â‚¬ each.

## Berlin Hackathon

We had a lot of fun this weekend and developed a small game where you had to solve quests with a clone which mirrors your motion and from level to level it got harder because movement axis inversed. :D

Yeah nevermind, we thought we would never win but the jury thought this was the funniest and most interesting idea and we won.

The first price was the finals in Shanghai, China...

## Bummers and Chances

So we won, hurray! Everyone was stunned and happy from the outcome. But the first bummer came on the next day via email. The event organizers wrote us, that they only have budget to fund 3 of every team to come to China.

Our team was faced with the first cruical test. How should we decide who should go? What does not going mean to the teammates who stay? And so on...

In the end from my point of view it could have worked out better. But decissions had to be made fast because we had like a time frame of two weeks between the VRBLN Hackathon and the trip to Shanghai.

I thought about who could found us to get the whole team to Shanghai and explained the situation to my CTO and my professor at the university.

In the end both said yes and ART+COM paid for my flight and the Beuth University, Berlin paid for my stay. (A huge thank you for both!!!). So in the end we could send four teammembers to Shanghai.
