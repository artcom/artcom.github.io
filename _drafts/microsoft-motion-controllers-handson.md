# The new Microsoft Motion Controllers and Acer Mixed Reality Headset
Today we had the chance to take a first look at the new Microsoft Motion Controllers and the Acer Mixed Reality (MR) headset in our office.
As partner for a health/medicine research project we are about to create a mixed reality tutorial and instructions for a lab, where medics in India can learn the procedure to learn the process of produce the product. We will keep you up-to-date on this blog.

Setting it up is easy as 1,2,3. Just start the Mixed-Reality Portal Application on your Windows10 machine, procede through the setup, where you basically just carry around the headset in a rectangle which should be your playspace and voila, done.

Now we are able to put on the headset and dive into the MR enviroment.

## Hello World

A samll example on how to use them and a demoscene will follow tomorrow.
