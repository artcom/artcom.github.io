## What we need

Board:
- Tickets
- Configurable columns
- WIP (work in progress) limits

Ticket:
- Description
- Comments
- Attach media
- Set relations to other tickets
- Use (multiple) colored tags to categorize
- Assignable
- Subscribe to changes

What else:
- Communcication channels priority: Ticket > Email > Chat
(https://about.gitlab.com/2016/03/03/start-with-an-issue/)
- Wiki/ Documentation
- Process for code reviews

The communcication of all stakeholders should converge in the corresponding ticket.
It's a always frustrating to collect communcication parts from different sources, like
email, chats and comments. A fortior, if external collbaborateurs take part they should be easily
integrated in the process to prevent communcation overflow.

## What not

- Progress per ticket: Tickets should comprise small tasks (max. 2-3 days).
- Forced to daily update the status.
- Deadlines per Ticket: A ticket comprises a small task. Multiple tasks can be wrapped in a milestone,
which can be used to track the overall progress and set due dates.
- Documentation: Produces to much overhead and it is in fact the wrong place. Completed tasks should be
documentated in a separate document (e.g. Wiki). Progress and impediments should be discussed in daily Stand Ups.
Decisions should be updated in the ticket description, not as comment.

## In detail

### Redmine + Agile Plugin

No possibility to configure columns per board (project). Here, columns correspond to
a "status". But a "status" is an overall attribute for all projects and only can be edited by the
administrator.

Furthermore there are no options to set mulitple tags per ticket. "Categories" which are supported are not
sufficient, because it is only allowed to set one per ticket.

### GitLab

Gitlab offers one issue board per repository. Accidently, we cannot set WIP limits
Relations to other tickets are only available in an Enterprise Edition with costs.

### Taiga

Taiga offers most of the required features, but the offered processes are very strict.
E.g. a Kanban board can only contain user stories.

### Kanboard

Free open-source tool, which offers a lot of the required features. It's very slim and has low requirements.
Because it's missing a possibility to subscribe to changes and it's visual backwardness, it's more useful as a
Personal Kanban Board.

### JIRA

The tool we want, providing all required features and more. But it is with costs.
