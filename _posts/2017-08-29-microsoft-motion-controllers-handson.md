Today we had the chance to take a first look at the new Microsoft Motion Controllers and the Acer Mixed Reality (MR) headset in our office.
As partner for a health/medicine research project we are about to create a mixed reality tutorial and instructions for a lab, where medics in India can learn the procedure to learn the process of produce the product. We will keep you up-to-date on this blog.

## Hands-On

### Headset
Setting it up is easy as 1,2,3. Just start the Mixed-Reality Portal Application on your Windows10 machine, procede through the setup, where you basically just carry around the headset in a rectangle which should be your playspace and voila, done.

Now we are able to put on the headset and dive into the MR enviroment.

#### Result:

> The headset is very lightweight. Its headstrap reminds me on the one of the new Vive headstrap. You can fold the google-part up, so working with it while carrying it on your head is quite comfortable and less annoying.

### Motion Controllers
The Motion Controllers need a little more setup. Because you need the newest version of the Windows 10 Insider Built, which comes with the drivers for the controllers.
Once setup, just plug-in the bluetooth dongle and connect the controllers via the Mixed-Reality Portal application.

#### Result:

> The Motion Controllers, feel very light-weight. They look and feeld very welll designed and engineered, like every finger matches the button and control-stick positions naturally. The LEDs in the ring of the controllers, which need to be there for the tracking system, look very futuristic and cool.

## Hello World

A samll example on how to use them and a demoscene will follow as soon as we find time.
