title: Go with the Crow, in 360°
---
Just outside the window my co-worker is feeding the crows every day. So today I
decided to put them to work, as testing models for our shiny new Kodak 4k 360°
camera rig. 

Put it in your Samsung Gear or cardboard VR player, turn around and wait for them to come picking up their treats. The crows will come in around 1:10 in the vid, and don't forget, you might need to turn around to actually see them.

Of course, serious content to comne. Stay tuned if you like to get more news
bits from the tech trenches at artcom.
