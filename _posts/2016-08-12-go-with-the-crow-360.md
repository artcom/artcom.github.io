## Go with the Crow, in 360°

Just outside my window my co-worker is feeding the crows every day. So today I put them to work, as testing models for our shiny new Kodak 4k 360° camera rig.

Put it in your Samsung Gear or cardboard VR player, turn around and wait for them to come picking up their treats.

Of course, serious content to comne, stay tuned.
