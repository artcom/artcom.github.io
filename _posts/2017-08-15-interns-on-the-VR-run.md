Point is, they did all great, but of course I'm specially proud of our interns [khaled] and [mio] which where part of the team as well as [thereza] who joins our engineering team in september. 

Now you can read all this in detail in the [original chinese][yivian]. If you prefer the real thing, go check out the [source code repository].

I'm really happy for the team, and I'm looking forward to continue working on insteresting VR / AR / 360 projects with them in the @artcom yolodeck. Stay tuned, we publish on our VR projects on this channel here soon. 

Most importantly, __ALL THE BEST LUCK FOR YOUR GLOBAL FINAL IN CHINA NOW!__ Go get the main prize now! 100.000 USD makes for a big splendid party I guess ;)

have fun
