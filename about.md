ART+COM development group. Stuff we do with software to be found here. For the visuals of our projects [check out our main site](http://artcom.de/en/), but here you might find the missing details on how we did it, or, to be more precise, [the public open source parts of it](https://github.com/artcom).

### More Information

ART+COM Studios designs and develops new media installations and spaces.

We use new technology as an artistic medium of expression and as a medium for
the interactive communication of complex information. In the process, we are
improving the technologies constantly and exploring their potential for spatial
communication and art. [(even more on our main site..)](http://artcom.de/en/about/)
